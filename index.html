        <h2>Breaking Bad Storyline</h2>
        
        <p>Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White (<strong>Bryan Cranston)</strong>, a chemistry teacher who lives in <em>New Mexico</em> with his wife (<strong>Anna Gunn)</strong> and teenage son (<strong>RJ Mitte)</strong> who has cerebral palsy. White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a <strong>kingpin</strong> of the drug trade.</p>
